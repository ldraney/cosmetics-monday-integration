# Vendor Integration Plan for Monday.com Cosmetics Platform

## 🎯 Overview

This document outlines the strategy for integrating a **Vendors Board** with our existing cosmetics Monday.com infrastructure, creating a comprehensive supply chain management system that connects ingredients → vendors → pricing → formulas in one unified workspace.

## 🏗️ Current Architecture

### **Existing Boards**
1. **🧬 INCI Master Database** (107 items)
2. **🧪 Ingredients Master Database** (563 ingredients with pricing)  
3. **🧪 Cosmetics Formulas** (78 formulas with cost calculations)
4. **💰 Ingredient Pricing Analysis** (cost optimization data)

### **Missing Link: Vendor Management**
Currently, ingredient pricing exists without supplier context, limiting our ability to:
- Compare supplier options
- Track vendor performance
- Negotiate better pricing
- Manage supply chain risks

## 🚀 Vendor Board Design

### **Core Vendor Information**
| Column | Type | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| Vendor Name | Text | Primary identifier |
| Contact Information | Long Text | Phone, email, address |
| Vendor Type | Status | Manufacturer, Distributor, Broker |
| Geographic Region | Dropdown | North America, Europe, Asia, etc. |
| Certifications | Tags | Organic, GMP, ISO, etc. |
| Payment Terms | Text | Net 30, Net 60, etc. |
| Minimum Order | Numbers | Minimum order quantities |
| Lead Time | Numbers | Average delivery days |

### **Performance Tracking**
| Column | Type | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| Reliability Score | Numbers | 1-10 performance rating |
| Quality Rating | Numbers | Product quality assessment |
| Price Competitiveness | Status | High/Medium/Low vs market |
| Last Order Date | Date | Most recent purchase |
| Total Orders | Numbers | Historical order count |
| Issues/Notes | Long Text | Quality issues, delays, etc. |

### **Financial Metrics**
| Column | Type | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| Annual Spend | Numbers | Total yearly purchases |
| Average Order Value | Numbers | Typical order size |
| Cost Savings | Numbers | Negotiated savings vs list price |
| Payment Status | Status | Current, Overdue, Credit Hold |

## 🔗 Integration with Existing Boards

### **Ingredients → Vendors Connection**
**Implementation**: Add "Primary Vendor" and "Alternative Vendors" dependency columns to Ingredients Board

**Benefits**:
- See supplier options for each ingredient
- Track vendor diversification
- Compare pricing across suppliers
- Identify single-source risks

**Example Connection**:
```
Propanediol ($5.47/kg)
├── Primary Vendor: Supplier A (Lead: 2 weeks, MOQ: 50kg)
├── Alt Vendor 1: Supplier B (Lead: 3 weeks, MOQ: 25kg, +15% cost)
└── Alt Vendor 2: Supplier C (Lead: 1 week, MOQ: 100kg, -5% cost)
```

### **Vendor → Formula Impact Analysis**
**Implementation**: Create mirror board showing vendor impact on formula costs

**Capabilities**:
- See all formulas affected by a vendor disruption
- Model cost impact of switching suppliers
- Prioritize vendor relationships by formula value
- Plan inventory based on lead times

## 📊 Vendor Intelligence Dashboard

### **Key Metrics to Track**
1. **Supplier Diversification Index**: % of ingredients with multiple vendor options
2. **Cost Optimization Score**: Potential savings from vendor negotiations
3. **Supply Chain Risk**: Ingredients dependent on single vendors
4. **Performance Trends**: Vendor reliability and quality over time

### **Automated Alerts**
- **Price increases** > 10% from any vendor
- **Quality issues** reported multiple times
- **Lead time extensions** beyond normal ranges
- **New vendor opportunities** for high-cost ingredients

    { title: "Vendor Type", type: "status" },
    { title: "Region", type: "dropdown" },
    { title: "Certifications", type: "tags" },
    { title: "Reliability Score", type: "numbers" },
    { title: "Lead Time (Days)", type: "numbers" },
    { title: "Connected Ingredients", type: "dependency" }
  ];
  // Implementation details...
};
```

### **Vendor-Ingredient Connection Script**
```javascript
// connect-vendors-ingredients.js
const connectVendorsToIngredients = async () => {
  // Map vendor relationships to ingredients
  // Update pricing with vendor context
  // Create alternative supplier tracking
};
```

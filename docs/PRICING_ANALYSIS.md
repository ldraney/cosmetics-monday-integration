## üîç Pricing Methodology

### **Unit Standardization Process**
1. **Volume to Weight**: Convert mL to kg using density estimates
   - Oils: ~0.9 g/mL
   - Water-based: ~1.0 g/mL
   - Powders: Variable density factors

2. **Weight Standardization**: Convert all units to kg
   - Grams ‚Üí kg (√∑1000)
   - Ounces ‚Üí kg (√∑35.274)
   - Pounds ‚Üí kg (√∑2.205)

3. **Per-Unit Calculation**: Break down bulk pricing
   - "Per 100g" ‚Üí kg pricing (√ó10)
   - "Per bottle" ‚Üí estimate kg equivalent

### **Quality Assurance Checks**
- **Market validation**: Compare against industry benchmarks
- **Outlier detection**: Flag prices >3 standard deviations from mean
- **Cross-reference**: Validate against supplier catalogs when available
- **Usage weighting**: Prioritize accuracy for high-usage ingredients

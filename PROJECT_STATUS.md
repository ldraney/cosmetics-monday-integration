# COSMETICS MONDAY INTEGRATION - PROJECT STATUS

## ðŸš€ Quick Resume Instructions
When you start a new Claude session:
1. Navigate to: `/Users/earthharbor/projects/project-pel-lab/cosmetics-monday-integration`
2. Say: "Read PROJECT_STATUS.md and CLAUDE.md to understand the current state"
3. Run: `node debug-monday-api.js` to check Monday connectivity
4. Run: `node board-status-monitor.js` to see board health

## ðŸ“Š Current Project State (as of 2025-07-19)

### âœ… COMPLETED
1. **Created 3-tier Monday.com structure** in "Cosmetics Testing Lab" workspace:
   - ðŸ§¬ INCI Board: https://monday.com/boards/9625740593 (305 INCI names)
   - ðŸ§ª Ingredients Board: https://monday.com/boards/9625733140 (563 ingredients)
   - ðŸ§ª Formulas Board: https://monday.com/boards/9625728737 (78 formulas)
   - ðŸ’° Pricing Board: https://monday.com/boards/9625728790 (empty)

2. **Extracted pricing data from inFlow inventory**:
   - 290 ingredient pricing matches found
   - Saved to: `inflow-pricing-matches.json` and `.csv`
   - Key prices: Propanediol $5.47/kg, Olivem 1000 $38.80/kg, Xanthan Gum $48.66/kg

3. **Added pricing columns** to boards:
   - Ingredients: "Price per KG" column (ID: numeric_mkt0v0h6)
   - Formulas: "Total Cost per KG" column

4. **Created monitoring infrastructure**:
   - `board-status-monitor.js` - Health checks for all boards
   - `debug-monday-api.js` - API connectivity troubleshooting

### ðŸš§ IN PROGRESS
1. **Monday API Connection Issue**:
   - API returning undefined for board queries
   - Need to debug authentication/query format
   - Run `node debug-monday-api.js` first!

2. **Pricing Upload Pending**:
   - 290 pricing matches ready in `inflow-pricing-matches.json`
   - Waiting for board population to complete
   - Use `match-inflow-pricing.js` when ready

### ðŸ“‹ TODO LIST
1. Fix Monday API connection issue
2. Upload pricing data to Ingredients board
3. Connect Formulas â†’ Ingredients relationships
4. Connect Ingredients â†’ INCI relationships
5. Set up automatic cost calculations
6. Create cost analysis dashboard

## ðŸ”§ Key Files

### Scripts Created:
- `sync-formulas.js` - Syncs formulas to Monday
- `create-ingredients-board.js` - Creates ingredients board
- `create-inci-board.js` - Creates INCI board
- `match-inflow-pricing.js` - Matches inFlow pricing to ingredients
- `save-pricing-matches.js` - Saves pricing to JSON/CSV
- `board-status-monitor.js` - Monitors board health
- `debug-monday-api.js` - Debugs API issues

### Data Files:
- `inflow-pricing-matches.json` - 290 pricing matches ready to upload
- `inflow-pricing-matches.csv` - Same data in spreadsheet format
- `.env` - Contains board IDs and API token

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL NEXT STEPS

1. **Debug Monday API**:
   ```bash
   node debug-monday-api.js
   ```

2. **Check board status**:
   ```bash
   node board-status-monitor.js
   ```

3. **Upload pricing** (once API fixed):
   ```bash
   node match-inflow-pricing.js
   ```

4. **Connect relationships**:
   - Need to create `connect-formula-ingredients.js`
   - Will link formulas to ingredients with percentages
   - Enable automatic cost calculations

## ðŸ’¡ Important Context

### Database Structure:
- **Local PostgreSQL**: `cosmetics_data_hub_v2_local`
- **78 formulas**, **563 ingredients**, **1057 relationships**
- **60.2% INCI coverage** (339 ingredients with INCI names)

### Monday Structure Goal:
```
Formulas â†’ (connects to) â†’ Ingredients â†’ (connects to) â†’ INCI
         â†“                            â†“
    Total Cost                  Price per KG
    (calculated)                (from inFlow)
```

### InFlow Pricing Data:
- Source: `/Users/earthharbor/Downloads/inFlow_ProductDetails (2).csv`
- 1,210 items total, 290 matched to formula ingredients
- Prices in various units (kg, g, oz, etc.) - all converted to $/kg

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Criteria
When complete, you should be able to:
1. See all formulas with calculated costs per KG
2. Click any formula to see ingredient breakdown with costs
3. Click any ingredient to see which formulas use it
4. Update pricing and see formula costs auto-update

## ðŸ“ž Resume Command
In new Claude session, say:
```
I'm continuing the cosmetics Monday.com integration project. 
Please read PROJECT_STATUS.md and check the current board health, 
then help me upload the pricing data and create formula-ingredient connections.
```

Good luck! ðŸš€
